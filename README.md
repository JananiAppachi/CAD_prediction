 Coronary Artery Disease Prediction through Machine Learning
Overview:
This project aims to enhance the prediction of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) using machine learning algorithms. CAD is a major cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project leverages various machine learning models to predict CAD, providing non-invasive solutions and contributing to better healthcare management.

Dataset:
The project utilizes the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which includes the following features:

Age: Age of the patient
Sex: Gender of the patient (0 = male, 1 = female)
CP: Chest pain type (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic)
Trestbps: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
Chol: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
Fbs: Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl) (1 = true, 0 = false)
Restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = left ventricular hypertrophy)
Thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
Exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping)
Ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
Thal: Thallium stress test result (0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect, 3 = not described)
Target: Presence of CAD (0 = no disease, 1 = disease present)
